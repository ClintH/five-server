# Five Server

Development Server with **Live Reload** Capability.  
(Maintained **F**ork of **Live-Server**)

- Rewritten in TypeScript
- Up-to-date dependencies

Not only are the dependencies of **Five-Server** up-to-date, but the repository also contains [maintainted forks](https://github.com/yandeu/five-server/tree/main/src/dependencies) of **connect**, **send** and **serve-index**.

_Someday, I guess it makes sense merging these 3 dependencies back to the origin. (Not sure if the maintainers are interested)_
